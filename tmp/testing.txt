Starting an all new file but the same name.
Still adding to it in nano.
I think I'm getting it now. 
First, open the file in nano.
Second save those changes.
Third, 'git add testing.txt'
Fourth, git commit -m "put in what-I-was-thinking comments here"
Fifth, check 'git status'
I'm adding more things to github from the editor in the web browser.
